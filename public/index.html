                <h2 class="mb-3">Who are "The KLF"?</h2>

                <p><strong>The KLF</strong> are a British dance music group who were active between 1987 and 1992. They were formed by Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty who were already producing music under the name "The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu".</p>
                <p>In 1988 they started producing underground house music and used the name "<strong>The KLF</strong>".</p>
                <p>In 1990 they remixed three of their earlier tunes, adding a live stadium feel to the tracks.  These tracks were "What Time Is Love? (Live at Trancentral)", "3AM Eternal (Live at the SSL)", and "Last Train To Trancentral (Live from the Lost Continent)"</p>
                <p>On "What Time Is Love?" and "Last Train To Trancentral" they used short samples from Wanda Dee's "To The Bone", amongst other samples.</p>
                <p>These records charted high in the UK.  "What Time Is Love" at number 5, "3AM Eternal" at number 1, and "Last Train To Trancentral" at number 2.</p>

                <h2 class="mb-3">What is Wanda Dee's claim?</h2>
                <p>Eric Floyd, Wanda Dee's manager, heard "What Time Is Love" in a club and wasn't impressed. He contacted "<strong>The KLF</strong>" and demanded payment.  It was agreed that Wanda Dee would get a payment, royalties, co-writing credits on the singles and on the US release of "<strong>The KLF</strong>'s" album "The White Room", and appear in the video's for the singles.</p>

                <p>After "<strong>The KLF</strong>" disbanded in 1992, Wanda Dee started touring the world billing herself as "The KLF Experience" or "The Voice of The KLF". She has continued doing this for the last 25 years.</p>
